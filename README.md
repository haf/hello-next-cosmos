# Hello Next.JS + React-Cosmos

A quick way to get started with the latest Next.JS and react-cosmos configured together.

## `.babelrc`

`next/babel` has these presets:

 - preset-env
 - preset-react
 - preset-typescript
 - plugin-proposal-class-properties
 - plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread
 - plugin-transform-runtime
 - styled-jsx

From https://nextjs.org/docs#customizing-webpack-config:

<blockquote>
These presets / plugins should not be added to your custom .babelrc. Instead, you can configure them on the next/babel preset
</blockquote>
